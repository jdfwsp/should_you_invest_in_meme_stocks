- use Jupyter for development, but export a stand-alone script
- start using our script at least 1-2 weeks before due date, so we can track performance and provide META-data (which we will also analyze ðŸ¤“)
    - possible option:    A script that asks user for input (Name, Stocks to buy, Amount, Frequency), then builds the portfolio for them and gives them on-demand reports
        - could make suggestions based on risk selection (high, medium, low)
        - stores data in SQL db but can also export csv reports (possibly with graphics)

I'm counting on learning how to do a lot of these things in the next few weeks but I think we should be able to have our project working by the time they are having us work on it in class time, then we can spend that time tweaking/polishing it.

What would y'all like this thing to do?
